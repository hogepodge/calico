#### Automatic host endpoint management

Calico v3.14 provides a new controller for automatically managing HostEndpoints for your Kubernetes nodes. This makes it easy to use Calico’s host policy enforcement features in dynamic environments where cluster nodes may come and go - for example, AWS instance auto scaling groups.

Related PRs:

 - kube-controllers can now automatically provision host endpoints for nodes in the cluster. [kube-controllers #458](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/458) (@lmm)
 - Add a new Profile with allow-all rules named `projectcalico-default-allow`. This profile can be used in host endpoints to provide default-allow in the absence of policy. [libcalico-go #1207](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1207) (@lmm)
 - Configure automatic host endpoints to use the default allow profile [kube-controllers #470](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/470) (@lmm)

#### Even more host endpoint policy

Calico host endpoints come in two flavors - interface-specific host endpoints which represent a single interface on a node, or wildcard host endpoints which represent all interfaces on the node. To-date, wildcard host endpoints have supported only pre-DNAT global network policies. In Calico v3.14, we’ve extended support to include other policy types as well, enabling you to more easily apply network policy to your hosts. Combined with the automatic provisioning of host endpoints discussed above, this enables a simple and powerful way to protect both Kubernetes pods and hosts using Calico’s unified policy model.

Note that this feature includes a change to the default behavior for wildcard host endpoints - make sure to read the upgrade documentation if you are currently using wildcard host endpoints in your cluster.

#### Encryption using Wireguard technology preview

We’re really excited to share that Calico v3.14 includes the ability to enable host-to-host encryption for pod traffic using Wireguard. While it’s not yet ready for production due to a few gaps and limited testing, it’s a great preview of what’s to come and we’ll be working hard to promote this feature to GA in future releases.

#### Configure and monitor IP borrowing

Calico will handle dynamically borrowing addresses from other nodes in order to maximize usage of the IP address space. However, there are times when this behavior is not desirable. For example, if your network infrastructure does not allow advertisement of the resulting /32 routes.

In Calico v3.14, you can now disable IP borrowing by enabling strict IP affinity using calicoctl. You can also use calicoctl to see what, if any, addresses have been borrowed from other nodes.

BPF dataplane technology preview improvements:

 - In BPF mode, fix that RPF check was bypassed for traffic to local workloads behind a nodeport. [felix #2283](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2283) (@tomastigera)
 - In BPF mode, fix some corner cases in conntrack whitelisting and add additional tests. [felix #2281](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2281) (@tomastigera)
 - In BPF mode, upgrade from the previous version may result in connections being silently dropped.  This is due to adjusting the format of the connection tracking BPF map. [felix #2277](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2277) (@tomastigera)
 - In BPF mode, fix source address of encapped node port packet when it should differ from original ingress IP [felix #2296](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2296) (@fasaxc)
 - Felix now checks the kernel version before enabling BPF mode. [felix #2288](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2288) (@fasaxc)
 - In BPF mode, Felix now sets the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl by default to restrict access to the BPF syscall.  This behaviour is controlled by the BPFDisableUnprivileged configuration parameter. [felix #2261](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2261) (@fasaxc)
 - The MTU used by the BPF programs when sending ICMP TOO BIG messages in order to control path MTU is now configured by the VXLANMTU configuration parameter. [felix #2251](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2251) (@tomastigera)
 - In BPF mode, fix lack of FIB lookup due to using incorrect endianess. [felix #2250](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2250) (@tomastigera)
 - The BPF dataplane now handles ICMP error messages as "related" traffic so that they follow the same path back through the dataplane as the packet they respond to. This improves compatibility with path MTU detection and other non-mainline traffic. [felix #2247](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2247) (@tomastigera)
 - In BPF dataplane mode, Felix now handles single-block IPAM pools.  Previously single-block pools resulted in a collision when programming the dataplane routes. [felix #2245](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2245) (@fasaxc)
